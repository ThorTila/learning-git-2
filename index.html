  <h1>No roots</h1>
  <h2>Alice Merton</h2>
  <p>I like digging holes and hiding things inside them<br>When I'll grow old I hope I won't forget to find them<br>'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night</p>
  <p>I built a home and wait for someone to tear it down<br>Then pack it up in boxes, head for the next town running<br>'Cause I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night</p>
  <p>And a thousand times I've seen this road,<br>A thousand times</p>
  <p>(x2)<br>I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground<br>I've got no roots, but my home was never on the ground<br>I've got no roots uuuh uuuh uh uh<br>I've got no roots</p>
  <p>I like standing still, boy that's just a wishful plan<br>Ask me where I come from, I'll say a different land<br>But I've got memories and travel like gypsies in the night</p>
